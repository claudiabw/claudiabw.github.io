			<p>I wanted to design a new kind of calendar app to keep track of everything you need to do for the day in one place.<br><br>I love that I am able to keep track of the seemingly never ending list of tasks I need to accomplish in my phone; one thing that I can usually be pretty sure I won't be without. One thing that I have found in my daily use, however, is that, as an iPhone user, I often forget to check my Reminders application unless I set an alert for a specific time. Even then, I often end up just pressing 'Later' because it turns out I am not in a position to complete that task at that particular moment, or 'Complete' because I don't want to then set a new time because I don't know when I will be available to do it.<br><br>Of course, this happens most often with tasks that are not the highest on my priority list, but still ends up proving to bit a bit of inconvenience. After speaking with a few friends and realizing I was not the only person with this problem (or that other people did not use the Reminders app at all), I decided to come up with a better solution.<br><br>That solution: integrating to-do items with your everyday calendar.</p>
