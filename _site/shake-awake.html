			<p>Shake Awake is a vibrating alarm clock with an embedded weight sensor.<br/><br/>Many college students struggle with waking up and actually getting out of bed. Shake Awake looks to solve that problem with its addition of a weight sensor and its placement under your pillow, keeping you from sleeping through your alarm by not turning it off until you get up and it no longer senses the weight of your head on the pillow.</p>
			<h1 class="section-title">The Process</h1>
			<p>The idea was born after talking to a number of friends about their sleeping habits and realized as the final project for my Product Design class.<br/><br/>The original idea was a vibrating pillow alarm clock with a weight sensor, but as we moved forward with our prototyping we realized a more practical consumer product would be able to be added to a user's existing pillow, and chose to separate the two.<br><br>[insert sketches/3d mockup here]</p>
