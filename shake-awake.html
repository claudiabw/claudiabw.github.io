			<p>Shake Awake is a vibrating alarm clock with an embedded weight sensor.<br/><br/>Many college students struggle with waking up and actually getting out of bed. Shake Awake looks to solve that problem with its addition of a weight sensor and its placement under your pillow, keeping you from sleeping through your alarm by not turning it off until you get up and it no longer senses the weight of your head on the pillow.</p>
			<h1 class="section-title">The Process</h1>
			<p>The idea was born after talking to a number of friends about their sleeping habits and realized as the final project for my Product Design class.<br/><br/>The original idea was a vibrating pillow alarm clock with a weight sensor, but as we moved forward with our prototyping we realized a more practical consumer product would be able to be added to a user's existing pillow, and chose to separate the two.<br><br>[insert sketches/3d mockup here]</p>

			<p>An overwhelming majority of those asked found the Sonic Boom’s vibration system much too intense/jarring for an alarm clock and agreed that they would want something less aggressive if they were to continuously use the product.</p>
			<p>So we set off to find the perfect balance of strong enough to wake you up but not aggressive enough to make you want to stop using the product forever.</p>
			<p>To Alibaba! (pro tip: don’t search “vibrator”)</p>
			<p>After perusing the many different options [PICTURES], we ultimately settled on these [picture!] coin-shaped motors, as we reasoned that the smaller size and relatively low thickness would make them more comfortable to sleep on (as is our goal).</p>
			<p>Once our order arrived, we had to set up another test to determine just how many sensors to use to achieve our desired results.</p>
			<p>For these tests, we assembled three different options -- one with two sensors, one with four, and one with six. We then had our testers evaluate each of the three options and give us their preferences. The winning prototype was that with six motors.</p>
			<p>We returned to Alibaba in order to find the right weight sensor to suit our needs. We knew again we wanted it to be small, so as not to interfere with comfortable sleeping. We ultimately selected this one [picture], and then set out to find the best options for the clock integration itself.</p>
			<p>We chose to use Arduino hardware and software for the alarm clock functionality, and after looking through our various options, chose to implement it with the Arduino Yun Shield in order to take advantage of the option to directly connect a screen.</p>
			<p>The final product looked like this: [pics]</p>
			<p>It was very well-received at the product showcase, and is now being used by the professor of the class an example for his future students.</p>
